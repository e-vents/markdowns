# JavaScript - Basics
JavaScript is a very flexible language. You don't have to be disciplined and you don't have to be particularly structured, to use this language. Furthermore JavaScript has a number of functions which can only be called bugs. You need to know these in order to work properly with this language. In the following chapters we'll take a closer look at the language. Basic knowledge in an object oriented language is required.
## Data types
JavaScript knows the following data types
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object
### Strings
You can use single or double quotes to define a string.
```javascript
> s = 'Hello World'
"Hello World"
> typeof s
"string"
```
Strings are a separate data type, but like objects have their own methods and attributes.
```javascript
> s.charAt(1)
"e"
> s.length
11
```
Like Java-Strings JavaScript-Strings are immutable and working with obejct references.
